The attached pink/magenta FreeShow logo image will be saved here. Since I cannot directly process the image file from the attachment, you'll need to manually save the logo image you provided to the following locations in your assets folder:

1. Replace `assets/icon.png` with your new logo (1024x1024px recommended)
2. Replace `assets/adaptive-icon.png` with your new logo (for Android adaptive icons)
3. Replace `assets/splash-icon.png` with your new logo (for splash screen)
4. Replace `assets/favicon.png` with your new logo (for web favicon)

The logo should be saved in PNG format at the appropriate sizes:
- icon.png: 1024x1024px
- adaptive-icon.png: 1024x1024px (this will be the foreground of Android's adaptive icon)
- splash-icon.png: Can be same as icon.png
- favicon.png: 32x32px or 48x48px
